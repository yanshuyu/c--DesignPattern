attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
*  Component: declares the common interface for both wrappers and wrapped objects.
*  Concrete Component: a class of objects being wrapped. 
*  Base Decorator: class has a field for referencing a wrapped object. The fieldâ€™s type should be declared as 
   the component interface so it can contain both concrete components and decorators. The base decorator delegates all operations to the wrapped object.
*  Concrete Decorators: define extra behaviors that can be added to components dynamically.
